Hello! This is the repo to go along with the Eyeo workshop on Turning Data into Sound and Music.

There are three examples in this repo: two in Python, and one in p5.js.

Please download MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) or a midi sheet music reader of your choice.

Our p5.js example will work with samples - there are some included in this repo, but you are also free to download some you like better. I suggest NASA's free library of space sounds:
