Hello! This is the repo to go along with the Eyeo workshop on Turning Data into Sound and Music.

There are three examples in this repo: two in Python, and one in p5.js.

Please download MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) or a midi sheet music reader of your choice.

Our p5.js example will work with samples - there are some included in this repo, but you are also free to download some you like better. I suggest NASA's free library of space sounds:

https://soundcloud.com/nasa (must be logged in to SoundCloud to download).

### Schedule (ish):

#### 9-10:15 
Introduction to my work. Intro to data sonification - what kind of data works best, what kind of mappings work for which type of data? We'll talk about the dataset we'll be working with, and go through any other datasets that participants brought in.

#### 10:15-10:45 
Setup and installation. Download repo. Create conda environments if needed (see below). Download additional software (MuseScore) and sound examples.
